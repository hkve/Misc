# Cards on the Street
This is based on a math problem a friend of mine introduced me to, here solved with a Monte Carlo approach. Here we stick to a deck size of 52 cards, however should work for other sizes as well. In the future, finding the expectation value of number of draws as a function of deck size could be interesting, some exponential scale is hypothesized.

The problem goes like this. Imagine you are collecting playing cards, with the wish to acquire a complete deck. The way you are allowed to add cards to your collection is to find them on the street. If the card you find is not present in your current deck, you keep it (and therefore increment the deck size by one). If you already have the card, you do nothing and walk on dreaming of finding a new card that you do not possess. The question then is, **how many** cards on average do you need to find before you have a complete deck?. The results from this approach yielded 235 cards using a deck size of 52. The distribution P(# of cards) is quite tail heavy. If you are very unlucky you might need to find 600 cards before you have a complete deck. On the contrary, if you are lucky 100 might be enough.
